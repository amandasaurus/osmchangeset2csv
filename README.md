## Todo

This software isn't finished, here's what I'd like to add. Feel free to send a patch

* Write to compressed output (Gzip & Bzip2). Also in a separate thread too
* Read (& uncompress) input file in a separate thread. This multiprocessing
  should make things faster.
* Query the OSM.org servers for current status, and update the CSV. e.g. close
  exisiting changesets, and add new one. The Dump is only once a week.


## Examples of it being used
